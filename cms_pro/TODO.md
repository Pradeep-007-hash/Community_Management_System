# TODO: Update UI/UX of userdashboard.jsx

- [x] Import additional icons from lucide-react for profile info items (e.g., User, Mail, Phone, etc.)
- [x] Change overall page theme to blue: Update main background from bg-gray-100 to bg-blue-50
- [x] Adjust sidebar colors for better blue theme consistency (if needed)
- [x] Create a new ProfileItem component styled like SidebarLink but non-clickable, with icon and label/value
- [x] Update the profile info section to use ProfileItem components instead of InfoItem
- [ ] Test the updated UI by running the application
